OpenXR-MotionCompensation Changelog

Version 0.2.8

	Motion controller interaction
	- added ability to compensate controller position
	- improved interaction profile path suggestion
	
	Graphical overlay
	- improved stability/compatibility
	- internal refactoring
	- prepared for (potential) future use of in-game menu

	MmfReader
	- added ability to write values to csv file
	
	Miscellaneous
	- simplified/improved handling of in-game recenter events
	- increased default tolerance for eye/pose reconstruction cache
	- added support for X-Plane 12
	
	Known issues
	- motion controller compensation does not work properly in MSFS main menu (controller movement gets blocked)
	- graphical overlay conflicts:
		- does not properly work with OpenXR Toolkit v1.3.2 (black screen instead of game, bug already reported to mbucchia)
		- iRacing displays marker only in left eye

Version 0.2.7
	
	Virtual tracker
	- enabled use of a motion controller to manipulate cor position
	- OpenComposite: added separate set of cor position values to be saved and loaded:
	  to continue to use saved cor position after update, reset for games using OC is required (either in game or copy/paste in config file(s))
	- SRS/Witmotion sensor: inverted pitch axis to match OVRMC:
	  Use inversion switch within motion compensation menu of SRS to match new behavior
	- added rotational offset (yaw) for cor positioning (applied after positioning)
	- added upside_down = 1 automatically on config file creation for iRacing

	Installer
	- fixed removal of prexisting oxrmc registry keys sharing path prefix
	
	Bugfixes
	- fixed ctd in DCS when loading mission with mc activated
	- fixed ctd in MSFS at startup without hmd / active runtime present
	- fixed default motion controller support in DCS
	- fixed vive tracker extension request causing issue on Varjo hmds, even when other tracker type is selected 
	
	Known issues
	- Assetto Corsa Competizione may only work with vive tracker if it is deactivated on game launch (tested on Varjo Base)
	- Overlay not working properly when using Varjo-Foveated API layer (marker gets transparent in focus area)

Version 0.2.6

	Automatic activation
	- added option to automatically activate motion compensation on application startup
	- added delay for auto activation
	- added audible countdown for auto activation

	Installer
	- added API layer reordering for Varjo-Foveated
	- updated layer reordering for OpenXR Toolkit (layer name changed)
	
	Filter
	- added ability to modify vertical translational filter strength
	
	Input
	- excluded inputs with additional modifiers (only for artificial keyboard input e.g. joy2key)
	
	Bugfixes
	- fixed multithreading bug causing ctd in MSFS
	- fixed performance issue in DCS World
	- fixed unit for translations in MMF reader app (m -> mm)
	
Version 0.2.5

	Graphical overlay
	- added toggle to deactivate initialization
	- configurable marker size
	
	Virtual tracker
	- added upside down mode (required  for iRacing)
	
	Physical tracker
	- added early initialization option (required for iRacing & DFR in OXRTK)

	Bugfixes
	- fixed crash on vr session end with oxrtk present
	- fixed physical tracker fallback initialization
	- fixed reference space creation causing cor position to jump on mc activation
	
	Known issues
	- incompatible with DCS World native OpenXR mode (unacceptable fps drop, under investigation)
	
Version 0.2.4

	Graphical overlay
	- added marker to visualize reference tracker
	- support for DirectX 11 and 12
	
	Disable functionality
	- deactivate completely
	- omit physical tracker initialization
	
	Configure pose reversion on frame submission
	- (optional) eye position cache (pre 0.1.4 method)
	- cache tolerance configurable

Version 0.2.3

	Tracker connection loss detection
	- unresponsive tracker is detected
	- motion compensation is deactivated after timeout

	MMF Reader
	- added application to display input values from memory mapped file(s) used for virtual trackers
	
	Installation Executable
	- Reorder loading of OpenXR Tookit to enable eye tracking / dynamic foveated rendering

	Bugfixes:
	- fixed loading order of OpenXR Toolkit to enable dynamic foveated rendering
	
Version 0.2.2

	Vive Tracker
	- added support for Vive tracker
	
	Bugfixes
